Hello, I’m Jiashu Yang (杨佳澍), an undergraduate student at <a href='https://www.dlut.edu.cn//'>Dalian University of Technology</a>. I’m currently in my third year of undergraduate studies. My GPA is **3.**/4.00.

My research interests include Multimodal Large Language Models, multimodal autonomous perception, and Human-Computer Interaction.
 

Since October 2023, I have been interning as a research intern at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of <a href='https://lianwenzhao.github.io/'>Dr. Wenzhao Lian</a>, working on embodied intelligence and visual perception. 

In June 2024, I worked with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3nE0agAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao'>Prof. Huchuan Lu (IEEE Fellow)</a> and <a href='https://stephenjia.github.io/'>Prof. Xu Jia</a>   on research related to multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
